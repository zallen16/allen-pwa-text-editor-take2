# Text Editor Starter Code

Using Progressive Web Applications, a text editor has been created. While seemingly simple, the PWA allows the app to be functional even while offline or if not fully supported by the browser it is being used on. Using a packaged called idb serving assistance to the IndexedDB API, starter code was distributed and us students handled the rest. Edit away!
